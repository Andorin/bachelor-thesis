    \href{http://www.fastcodesign.com/3046864/meet-project-jacquard-googles-plan-to-turn-    all-your-clothes-into-a-touchscreen#11}{Project Jacquard} &  
	Conductive thread allowing simple touch gestures to control devices via Bluetooth.\\ 
    \hline
    
    Modular and Deformable Touch-Sensitive Surfaces Based on Time Domain Reflectometry (Wimmer et al. '11) &  
    Time Domain Reflectometry is used to sense where a single wire is touched allowing the creation of non-planar, deformable 2D touch-enabled large surfaces. They compared different cable types testing signal change on touch, signal to noise, error offset, etc.\\
    \hline
    
    Pinstripe:Eyes-free Continuous Input on InteractiveClothing (Karrer et al. '11)&
    Using pinstripe as continuous input to detect pinching and rolling of clothing. Evaluating best sensor positions, ease of use and different granularities of control via user studies.\\ 
    \hline
    
    PocketTouch: Through-Fabric Capacitive Touch Input (Saponas et al. '11)&
    Capacitive multitouch-based gesture control and text input device for trough clothing smartphone input. Tested with different fabrics and materials. (Note: Not flexible yet)\\
    \hline
    
    Plex: Finger-Worn Textile Sensor for Mobile Interaction duringActivities (Yoon et al. '14) &
    Finger worn textile touch sensor using painted conductive elastomer allowing touch, press, finger bend, and swipe to be recognized. \\
    \hline
    
    Don?t Mind Me Touching My Wrist: A Case Study of Interacting with On-Body Technology in Public (Profita et al. '13) &
    Using a conductive thread for an e-textile Jogwheel to evaluate the social acceptance of e-textile interaction at different on-body locations.\\
    \hline
    
    SwitchBack: An On-Body RF-based Gesture Input Device (Hughes et al. '14) &
    Multi-directional continuous on-body input using Reflectometer sensing the location of one or more finger touching the conductive fabric stripe.\\
    \hline
    
    Needle User Interface:  A Sewing Interface Using Layered Conductive Fabrics (Nakagaki et al. '12) &
    A low resistance conductive layer in the center of two high resistance  layers can sense a needles orientation and position allowing realtime tracking of the string.\\

         FabriTouch: Exploring Flexible Touch Input on Textiles (Heller et al. '14)&
    Capacitive, fully flexible, wearable textile touchpad consisting of piezoresistive foil, spacing mesh and conductive fabric. In a user study they compared the users posture, gesture direction, gesture location, handedness preferences and their influence on  performance. \\
